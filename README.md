# Good Dog

## Summary
A web app that allows dog owners and/or dog enthusiasts to post their pet concerns on a public forum. Users can expect comments from people in their community who have experience with specific problems. Users can post comments of their own, helping other pet owners in need.

## Motivation
Being a dog owner myself, I wanted to create a forum that is dedicated solely to our loyal companions and their owners.
